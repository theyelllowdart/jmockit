/**
 * Provides the classes and annotations used when writing tests with the JMockit mocking APIs.
 * <p/>
 * The {@link mockit.Expectations} class provides an API for the traditional <em>record-replay</em> model of recording
 * expected invocations which are later replayed and implicitly verified.
 * This API makes use of the {@link mockit.Mocked} annotation.
 * <p/>
 * The {@link mockit.Verifications} class, when combined with the {@link mockit.NonStrictExpectations} class or the
 * {@link mockit.NonStrict} annotation, extends the record-replay model to a <em>record-replay-verify</em> model, where
 * the record phase can be left empty, with expected invocations verified explicitly <em>after</em> exercising the code
 * under test (ie, after the replay phase).
 * <p/>
 * The {@linkplain mockit.MockUp <code>MockUp&lt;T></code>} generic class (where {@code T} is the mocked type) allows
 * the definition of fake implementations for arbitrary classes.
